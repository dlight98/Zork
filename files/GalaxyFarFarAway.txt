One note before you start: PLEASE SAVE OFTEN! I messed up with calculating the
passage of time, and moving in a direction with no exit WILL crash the game. Save
often just in case!!!
Another note: Please play with "Verbose on". It allows you to read all descriptions
as well as see the exits, which is very important because of the aforementioned bug.

ANYTHING AFTER THIS POINT WAS WRITTEN AFTER THE ASSIGNMENT WAS TURNED IN

This isn't in either guide, but please do check out the neighbor's house

There is more to explore out there, like the neighbor's house and the upstairs in the Palace
but those are not necesarry for completion points so I left it out of the walkthrough.
