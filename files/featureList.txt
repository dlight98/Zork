Light(+20 XP): Light sources are availble in many rooms throughout the dungeon.
Some rooms are completely dark, and the player needs to have a light source turned
on in order to progress through it.

You can test Light by grabbing a torch or flashlight item from the Pitch Black room
and turning it on using the Power event.
