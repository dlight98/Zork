Light(+20 XP): Light sources are availble in many rooms throughout the dungeon.
Some rooms are completely dark, and the player needs to have a light source turned
on in order to progress through it.

You can test Light by grabbing a torch or flashlight item from the first room
and turning it on using the Power event.

------------------------------------------

External Clock and Time Limit (+30 XP): The game has an internal day and night cycle, and
a limited amount of time the player has to complete the game. 
A message will be displayed to tell when it is evening and when it is morning.
Each morning the number of days passed and days remaining are displayed.

The clock only adds time to the counter when the player:
1) sucessfully moves through an exit
2) Successfully using an Item-Specific command
3) Successfully picking up or dropping an item.
4) Looks around the Room

The clock will NOT add time when the player:
1) Fails to move through an exit (typing "n" in a room with no north exit)
2) Fails to use an item-specific command (types the command in wrong)
3) Fails to pick up or drop an item. Typing in an item that doesn't exist, etc.
4) Toggles verbose mode
5) checks the inventory
6) Saves the game

You can see how the time limit is in effect by repeatedly moving up and down ("u" and "d")
or in any other direction until the days run out. The game will then end.

------------------------
Verbose(+10xp): Verbose is typed and passsed with either "On" or "Off" which will then make
all the rooms display their descriptions on entry, no matter how many times they are entered. 

-----------------------
Closed Exits(+20xp): Closed exits do not allow the Adventurer to enter the next room if they room the 
Exit leads to is Dark. The adventurer needs to pick up a Light source and turn it on to enter the next
room. 

You can see how closed exits works by trying to go down when you are in the first room  without picking up and turning on 
the light source.
